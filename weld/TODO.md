# Todo list

*Get multi-user support going*: need multi-user support before
you can put review on the cloud

*Retool review code for bazel*: it was last built before bazel,
  needs to be fixed up to work correctly

  *Get review code onto the cloud*: should be straightforward

  *Find some way to bootstrap*: maybe need some way to sync changes
  back to git? Or automatically create PRs/apply changes to keep
  things synced on git? Since I don't really trust the code to be
  stored in itself yet.
